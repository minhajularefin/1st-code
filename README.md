## What is Single Channel:
If a system has one server which are service in one by one that is called single channel.

In this problem we were trying to find arrival time from inter arrival time.
Now, we have to know what is inter arrival time and what is arrival time.

## Inter Arrival Time:
The time difference between arrival of one customer and then the next customer is often referred to as Interarrival time. At that point the customer is coming into the system.

## Arrival Time:
The time when customer arrives, arrived, or will arrive. At that point the customer started working.

## Main Section
Now solving this problem
We know that. first customer has to arrive at 0 second. So first customer's inter arrival time and arrival time are 0.
Firstly, the inter arrival time for 19 customers has to be taken randomly. After taking randomly, it will be printed.
Secondly, the following formula has to be used to determine the arrival time.
Present arrival time = Previous arrival time + present inter arrival time.
